Analysis scripts for analyzing ABF simulations

 plot_overTraj.py       Plot cell dimensions over trajectory, using *.dat file from xst.sh.
 printWTT.tcl           Print WTT z-coordinate, relative to center of mass of C21, C31 from POPC units
 symmetrize_pmf_abf.py  Anti-symmetrize gradients of the PMF generated by NAMD. force = -grad(potential)
 viewtraj.tcl           Wrap and view selected trajectory.
 xst.sh                 See how the cell dimensions change over course of simulations in *.xst files.

 
 Some things to keep in mind when analyzing the plots:

   * PDB original cell dimensions
       51.313   68.416  116.890
    
   * xmgrace
       - Plot just first column
           xmgrace xst_win05_2-8.dat
       - Plot all columns
           xmgrace -nxy xst_win05_2-8.dat
       - Plot column 1 by column 3
           xmgrace -block xst_win05_2-8.dat -bxy 1:3
